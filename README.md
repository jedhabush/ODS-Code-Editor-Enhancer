1- Download as zip file or clone repo
1- unzip the file
2- go to your chrome extensions dropwdown list -> click manage extensions -> load unpacked -> load the unzipped folder as a whole called "ODS-code-editor dist"
3- I will be keen to see if there's any issues. some portals might not work properly due to permissions in the chrome extension itself but should work on majority of the data portals for now
